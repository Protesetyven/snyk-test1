CrossSelling, a Qlik Sense Extension based on the Venn Analysis
=============================
==================================


This extension is very useful for a cross selling analysis.
It's thought to identify sales oportunities in a very easy way.

For example, you can identify those customers that use to buy 
toothpaste and don't buy the toothbrush.

It does not need any set analysis, it works like that:
- Drag 2 dimensions, tipically customers and products
- And then select 3 products
- The metric will be done inside the extension :
  ("How many customers buy any combination of those products")
- If you want you can click on any number and the set of customers
  will be selected.
